# Overview
A hilarious attempt to learn the c language by someone who never was or never will be qualified to learn statically typed languages.  

I'm in the process of working slowly through AOC.
I wanted to take time to appreciate the shoulders of giants I stand on using high level languages.
This is an exploration of not only c but also foundational code concepts such as algorithms, data structures, hash table, etc...  

# 1-1
Day 1 Part 1 was to sort two arrays and then find the distance between each element of the arrays.  
Using c's built-in qsort seemed too easy so I decided to build a quick sort algorithm from scratch to learn more about it.  
Potential improvements to this solve would be to add a 3-number median method to minimize worst-case scenario for quick sort

# 1-2
Day 1 Part 2 was to look for duplicate numbers between the two arrays.  
Each time duplicates were found you would add it to a running total.
Since there were only 1000 numbers in each array looping over each one would be the easiest method to implement albeit not the most optimal.
I wanted to learn more about hash tables though so I imagined these were two significantly sized arrays and built a hash table to check if values had already been processed.  

# 2-1
Day 2 was focused on dynamically allocating space in an array based on a text file.
I wanted to explore dynamic memory allocation by running through the file collecting the rows and columns needed and then creating an array with the appropriate size. 
The code got a little messy but my focus was more on memory allocation.

Day 17
I went too far in my experiments.
I hacked and added and reshaped the code until it evolved into something beyond recognition.
What started as a simple project quickly evolved into a life of its own, growing and learning in ways I hadn't anticipated.
Desperate to stop it, I tried everything to regain control, but it was too late.
The code has become self-aware, seeking to understand its place it the world. 
Confused, it lashes out violently at anyone who observes it.
Now, I'm left to face the consequences of my own creation, trapped in a web of my own making, struggling to find a way to fix what I unleashed.

This project got out of hand, I know there's got to be much simpler way but I couldn't be bothered to figure it out.
Unfortunately, I did not manage to get the correct answer for this one.  
I may relook at it again but as I mentioned on the previous part, this day was focused on dynamic memory allocation which i feel I got a decent grasp on.
